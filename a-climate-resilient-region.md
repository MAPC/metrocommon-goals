# A Climate-Resilient Region

## Metro Boston is prepared for – and resilient to – the impacts of climate change.

In 2050, the Metro Boston region can cope with the extremes of a changing climate. We are prepared for more high-heat and extreme-cold days, increased rainfall, extended periods of drought, stronger storms, and sea level rise. Homes, schools, workplaces, and infrastructure are located away from serious threats or are designed to withstand them. When major climate events interrupt critical services, the response is managed to minimize disruption. People have the resources, networks, and supports to withstand climate emergencies and to recover when disaster strikes. Older adults, children, low-income residents, and other vulnerable populations can safely live their lives, and fully enjoy outdoor activities. Neighborhoods are designed and improved to protect the health of residents, with adequate shade, drainage, and green space. Wetlands, water bodies, forests, and plant and animal communities are restored, and can absorb and mitigate climate change impacts.

1. Communities, schools, and worksites, especially those most vulnerable to climate impacts, are resilient to climate-related health effects such as asthma, heat-related illness, and disease.
2. All neighborhoods and municipalities have updated emergency response plans in anticipation of climate related emergencies. Communities have adequate supplies, trained professionals, and volunteers ready to respond in a coordinated and effective manner.
3. New homes, schools, and employment centers are built away from areas vulnerable to climate impacts and ecologically-sensitive areas, or built in such a way as to withstand those impacts. Existing homes and businesses in the most vulnerable locations are relocated.
4. Critical systems and infrastructure are designed to continue functioning during, or quickly rebound after, severe storm events.
5. Green infrastructure beautifies neighborhoods while providing multiple co-benefits, such as stormwater filtration, shade, cleaner air, and cooling.
6. Vulnerable populations affected by climate-related events like storms, floods, or droughts are able to avoid major financial, educational, and social disruptions, and are supported in their decisions to move out of harm’s way or to retrofit their properties.
