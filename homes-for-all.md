# Homes for All

## All residents of Metro Boston have places to live that meet their needs, and which they can afford.

  
In the year 2050, people who live in the region, and those who move here, can find homes that suit their needs and incomes. Residents donâ€™t fear being priced out of their neighborhoods. Families of every size can choose from a range of housing types. As their needs change, residents can find reasonably priced options where they hope to live. No one is steered toward or away from any community because of their race, ethnicity, faith or other characteristics. New homes are integrated into neighborhoods close to jobs, shopping, schools, recreation, and transportation. Owners of older homes preserve them, while upgrading accessibility and energy performance. Homes are designed to meet the needs of our residents, including families with children, older adults, and people with disabilities.

1. Everyone has a home; homelessness is essentially non-existent.
2. Available housing meets the current needs of residents, as well as their future needs as they form families, age, and experience unforeseen circumstances like disabilities.
3. New housing is built primarily in walkable neighborhoods that have easy access to the goods, services, and amenities needed in daily life.
4. Enough new housing units are built to help moderate home sales prices.
5. New and existing housing, including deed-restricted units and naturally occurring affordable housing, are available at a range of price points that correspond to residents' income levels.
6. Communities have enacted policies and programs that avert displacement resulting from rent increases, evictions, condo conversions, foreclosures, and loss of deed-restricted housing.
7. Renters have access to credit and counseling that allows them to buy suitable homes in locations they desire, including in or near the communities where they work.
8. Neighborhoods more closely reflect the racial and income diversity of the region; residents can choose their community based on preference and opportunity, without being limited by historic segregation patterns.
