# Economic Security

## Everyone has the financial resources to meet their needs and to live fulfilling lives.

In 2050, residents of Metro Boston can provide for themselves and their families throughout their lives. Workers earn wages that support healthy lifestyles, access to opportunities, and allow for education, emergency savings, and retirement. Those in need receive services and supports from both public and private sources. Populations that have historically lacked or been denied wealth are now as likely as others to build wealth and pass it on. Employers provide job stability with “family first” policies. Young children have safe, affordable, and nurturing environments in their early years. Students thrive in high quality schools that prepare them for fulfilling work and life. Adults who want to expand their skills can find convenient and affordable higher education and training programs.

1. > Residents have enough wealth – or access to public or personal safety nets – to allow them to withstand economic disruptions, provide for post-secondary schooling, and retirement.
2. > The educational system is desegregated. Educational funding and resources are equitably distributed across the region.
3. > Employers, community-based organizations, the K-12 and higher educational systems, and government agencies collaboratively manage a successful workforce development pipeline that results in fulfilling employment.
4. > Employers in the region – combined with appropriate public support and in partnership with labor unions – provide their employees with living wages, affordable health care, reasonable vacation, sick and parental leave time, healthy working conditions, and stable retirement options.
5. > Populations that have historically faced unemployment or underemployment – in particular residents of color, low-income residents, women, those formerly incarcerated, older workers, and people with disabilities, find gainful employment earning living wages. There is equal pay for equal work.
6. > Government programs no longer have strict cut-offs \(cliffs\), allowing recipients to increase their incomes and economic mobility without losing all assistance.
7. > New economic models, such as cooperatively-owned businesses and Employee Stock Ownership Programs, provide wealth creation and business ownership opportunities, particularly for individuals with barriers to traditional employment and individuals interested in investing in the local economy.
