# A Net Zero Carbon Region

## The Metro Boston region is highly energy efficient and has reduced its greenhouse gas \(GHG\) emissions to net zero.

In 2050, Metro Boston is deeply energy efficient. We power our communities, buildings, and vehicles with renewable energy. The region benefits from having made deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions before 2030, as part of the global effort to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. Making zero-emissions choices for food, clothing, and other goods is easy, affordable, and convenient for everyone. The public health, resiliency, and other benefits of a net-zero carbon future are distributed equitably, lifting up all communities, particularly those historically bearing greater burdens.

1. Energy demand is significantly reduced and energy efficiency is maximized across the region.
2. Affordable carbon-free energy powers our electricity grid, and heating and cooling are fully decarbonized.
3. Renewable energy, including centralized, district-scale, and distributed generation and storage comprises the region’s primary sources of energy.
4. All new construction and major renovation projects meet net zero emissions standards for heating, cooling, and electricity needs, by 2030. Existing buildings meet this standard by 2050.
5. All land travel in the region is by carbon free modes of transportation \(i.e., walking, biking, electrified public transit, and passenger vehicles\). Air, freight, and marine transportation have significantly reduced carbon emissions.
6. The “Green Economy” supports local workforce development, entrepreneurs, and living wage jobs that foster more widespread economic opportunity.
7. The benefits and impacts of new energy infrastructure are distributed equitably across the region, with all groups benefiting and no geography or population bearing a disproportionate burden.
