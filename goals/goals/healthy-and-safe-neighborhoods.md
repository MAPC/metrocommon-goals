# Healthy and Safe Neighborhoods

## We are safe, healthy, and connected to one another.

In 2050, residents breathe clean air, drink clean water, and eat heathy foods. Across race, ethnicity, immigration status, age, income, and ability, people live longer, healthier lives because they live in neighborhoods that are welcoming and safe, and in homes that are stable and affordable. Residents travel through the region conveniently and safely, and they enjoy nearby parks and open space. Neighborhood design promotes social connections and healthy choices. Strong schools, jobs, social services help residents lead engaged and healthy lives. Violence, pollution, racism, and other risk factors are rare and actively deterred. Affordable and high-quality medical and behavioral health care, with an emphasis on prevention, is available to all.
