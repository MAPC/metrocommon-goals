# Dynamic and Representative Governments

## Local governments and regional agencies have the capacity and resources to deliver the services and supports our residents deserve, and to maintain and invest in our built and natural environments.

In 2050, local governments work together, often across municipal lines. Elected leadership and staff reflect the region’s diversity. Everyone can participate in government and take part in decision-making. Municipalities and regional entities are structured, sized, and have the capacity to address significant land use, mobility, and sustainability challenges effectively. They have the financial resources to address both our regional and local needs and the flexibility to raise the funds they need to accomplish that goal. Governments and health, educational, social service, and commercial enterprises act as partners, systematically supporting the region’s residents. The Commonwealth provides the guidance, incentives, and support needed to achieve the goals of the region and its local communities. All levels of government work together to make Metro Boston one of the healthiest, best educated, most equitable and resilient regions in the world.

1. > Cities and towns receive the federal and state revenue they need to support critical services, including schools, public safety, and transportation, and to ensure equity among communities.
2. > Cities and towns have greater flexibility to modernize their governance and to raise funds needed to address local issues, and they are careful stewards of these funds.
3. > Historically underrepresented populations work, volunteer, vote, serve in leadership positions, and are empowered in public decision-making.
4. > Complex policy issues, data, and processes are made accessible to and understandable by the public through better information design, technology, and educational programs.
5. > The Commonwealth provides cities and towns meaningful incentives to collaborate with each other in planning, procurement, and delivery of local services, including regionalization and consolidation where appropriate.
6. > Cities and towns form creative partnerships with health, education, and commercial entities in their communities.
7. > Municipalities work together and with regional government to plan for, coordinate, and fund vital functions such as land use, transportation, housing, water, and energy.
