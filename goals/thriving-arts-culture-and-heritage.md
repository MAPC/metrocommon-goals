# Thriving Arts, Culture, and Heritage

## Greater Boston is full of unique places and experiences that bring joy and foster diversity and social cohesion.

In 2050, residents and visitors of all backgrounds enjoy a wide variety of historical, cultural, and artistic experiences. Public art and cultural institutions reflect our regionâ€™s diversity. The arts are recognized for their intrinsic value. Public and private financial support make art more accessible to a broader audience. Residents of all ages have opportunities for art education and for creative expression. High-quality public programming and urban design adds vitality, cultural experiences, and walkability to our neighborhoods. New development complements and enhances existing town centers. Historic buildings and cultural landscapes are protected, enriching our civic life.

1. People of all ages participate in arts and cultural activities, building community and social networks.
2. Historic buildings, properties, and landscapes are adapted to meet contemporary needs.
3. New development is integrated into historic neighborhood fabric in complementary ways.
4. Policies, institutions, and the market sustain and support the arts, allowing artists to make a living.
5. Affordable spaces exist for artists to live and work in communities throughout Metro Boston.
6. Historic preservation activities document and preserve resources that include the full range of cultural heritage in our region.
