# Dynamic and Representative Governments

## State, regional, and local governments have the capacity and resources to deliver the services and supports our residents deserve and to maintain and invest in our built and natural environments.

In 2050, local governments work together, often across municipal lines. Elected leadership and staff reflect the diversity of the region’s people. Everyone can participate in government and take part in decision-making. Governments are structured, sized, and have the capacity to address significant land use, mobility, and sustainability challenges effectively. They have the financial resources to address our regional needs and the flexibility to raise local funds to address local issues. Governments, health, educational, social service, and commercial enterprises act as partners, systematically supporting the region’s residents. The Commonwealth provides the guidance, incentives, and support needed to achieve the goals of the region and its local communities. All levels of government work together to make Metro Boston one of the healthiest, best educated, most equitable and resilient regions in the world.

1. Cities and towns receive the federal and state revenue they need to support critical local services, such as schools, public safety, and transportation, and to ensure equity among communities.
2. Cities and towns are given greater flexibility to modernize their governance and to raise additional funds needed to address local issues.
3. Historically underrepresented populations work, volunteer, run for office, and are empowered in public decision-making processes.
4. Complex policy issues, data, and processes are made accessible to the public through better information design and technology.
5. The Commonwealth provides cities and towns meaningful incentives to collaborate with each other in planning, procurement, and the delivery of local services, and also to form creative partnerships with health, education, and commercial entities in their communities.
6. Municipalities work together and with regional government to plan for, coordinate, and fund land use, transportation, water, energy, resilience, and recreational assets.
