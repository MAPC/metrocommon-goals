# Economic Security and Prosperity

## Everyone has the financial resources to meet their needs and to live fulfilling lives.

In 2050, residents of Metro Boston can provide for themselves and their families throughout their lives. Workers earn wages that support healthy lifestyles, access to opportunities, and allow for retirement, school, and emergency savings. Those in need receive services and supports from both public and private sources. Populations that have historically lacked or been denied wealth are now as likely as others to build wealth and pass it on. Employers provide job stability with “family first” policies. Young children have safe, affordable, and nurturing environments in their early years. Children thrive in high quality schools, which prepare them for work and life. Adults who want to increase their skills can find convenient and affordable training programs. The region is a destination for students, entrepreneurs, investors, artists, and innovators, while at the same time expanding opportunities for current residents. New jobs are located near transit, other infrastructure, and existing services. The region has a thriving and varied business ecosystem from locally-owned stores to global companies.

1. Residents have enough wealth – or access to support – to allow them to withstand economic disruptions, provide for post-secondary school, and retire.
2. Policies, programs, and infrastructure allow for businesses of all sizes to thrive and provide fulfilling employment opportunities. Those business have the opportunity to expand and grow in smart growth locations.
3. Employers, the educational system, and government agencies collaboratively manage a successful workforce development pipeline that results in fulfilling employment.
4. Vacant and underutilized commercial and industrial sites are revitalized, and they provide new jobs close to population centers and transit.
5. Employers in the region – combined with appropriate public support – provide their employees with good wages, affordable health care, reasonable vacation, sick and parental leave time, healthy working conditions, and stable retirement options.
6. Populations that have historically faced unemployment or underemployment, in particular residents of color, low-income residents, those formerly incarcerated, seniors, and people with disabilities, find gainful employment making good wages.
7. Small businesses owners and immigrant entrepreneurs are a thriving part of the regional economy.
