![](https://mapc.az1.qualtrics.com/CP/Graphic.php?IM=IM_0fxpWWsvYtTSKih)

  
**What do you want for the future of our region?** 

For four months, people from all over Greater Boston have been telling us what they want for the region's future. We turned those ideas and hopes into nine draft goals: A climate-resilient region;  getting around the region conveniently and affordably; homes for all; a net zero carbon region; a healthy environment; economic security and prosperity; healthy and safe neighborhoods; thriving arts, culture, and heritage; and dynamic and representative government.

Now we want to hear how you feel about those draft goals. We'll read and record all responses, and look for trends. We'll finalize the goals with those trends in mind.
