# Healthy and Safe Neighborhoods

## We are safe, healthy, and connected to one another.

  
In the year 2050, residents breathe clean air, drink clean water, and eat heathy foods. Across race, age, income, and ability, people live longer, healthier lives because they live in neighborhoods that are welcoming and safe, and in homes that are stable and affordable. Residents travel through the region conveniently and safely, and they enjoy nearby parks and open spaces. Neighborhood design promotes social connections and healthy choices. Strong schools, jobs, and affordable and high-quality medical care help residents to lead engaged and healthy lives. Violence, pollution, racism, and other risk factors are rare and actively deterred.

1. Exposure to pollution has been minimized: no one lives in a place where air, water, or soil pollution could diminish life expectancy or quality.
2. Through enhanced public health initiatives and investments, the region has reduced the rates of chronic diseases and substance use disorders as well as the risks for communicable diseases.
3. People in the region live, work, attend school, worship, and travel without the risk of violence or crime.
4. People in the region have access to affordable, stigma-free mental health and substance abuse treatment and support networks.
5. Healthy food is accessible and affordable to all people in the region.
6. Residents have the resources to remove toxins, weatherize, and maintain their homes, while local governments have the resources to maintain their parks and open spaces.
7. The Commonwealth has replaced most incarceration with effective efforts at prevention, rehabilitation, and restorative justice; incarceration rates no longer vary by race
