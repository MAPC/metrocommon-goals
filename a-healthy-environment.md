# A Healthy Environment

## Greater Boston’s air, water, land, and other natural resources are clean and protected – for us and for the rest of the ecosystem.

In 2050, our air is pure, indoors and out. Our cities and towns are healthy, with beautiful parks and natural areas for all. And our cities are quieter, with less polluting and more efficient transportation technologies. Contaminated sites are cleaned up and turned to new uses. There is less waste. What waste there is produces energy, fertilizes soil, or is reprocessed. We have enough fresh water from our wells, streams, and reservoirs to meet human needs and the needs of wildlife. Our farms and fisheries produce plentiful and healthy yields, without reducing future harvests. Habitats, forest, wetlands, and other natural resources are protected and enhanced.

1. Water is clean and sustainably managed. Waterways exceed Clean Water Act standards and meet the appropriate needs of residents, industry, forests, farms, and wildlife.
2. A robust network of protected open spaces, waterways, farms, parks, and greenways provide wildlife habitat, ecological benefits, recreational opportunities, and scenic beauty.
3. Farms, fisheries, community gardens, and natural landscapes are prevalent, and able to adapt and thrive in the face of the changing climate. They offer residents access to fresh, healthy, and local food.
4. Historic Environmental Justice populations enjoy air, energy, and water as clean as any other population.
5. The region creates very little solid waste. What it does create is reused, composted, recycled, or turned into energy.
6. Almost no contaminated sites exist. Former contaminated sites were redeveloped to create jobs or homes, or restored to support green infrastructure, habitat, and to mitigate climate impacts.
