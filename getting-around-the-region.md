# Getting Around the Region

## Traveling around Metro Boston is safe, affordable, convenient, and enjoyable.

  
In the year 2050, the ways we get around are reliable and well maintained. Travel is safe, efficient, pleasant, and affordable to households of varying incomes. New transportation technologies and services blossom on our roads, underground, in the air, and on the water. These new travel options help to alleviate congestion or pollution, rather than adding to it. Public transit and shared trips are frequently more convenient than solo trips. Auto congestion may still exist, but it is predictable and avoidable. People with mobility limitations and those without a car can get around easily, and can afford to do so. Low-income residents and residents of color enjoy high quality transit to more parts of the region, improving access to opportunity. People of all ages walk or bike more frequently for short trips, because conditions make that option safe and enjoyable. The transportation system has a minimal impact on the local and global environment, with reduced pollution and runoff, and less land set aside for roadways or parking.

1. Transit infrastructure is well-maintained and strategically expanded so that daily travel is predictable and reliable, with a greater emphasis on circumferential travel and reverse commutes.
2. The transportation system is designed and operated to ensure access to opportunity for the communities who need it most, including neighborhoods historically underserved by high quality transit.
3. As the region grows, new development is concentrated around or accessible to transit.
4. Bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure is extensive, high quality, and linked to other modes, so that people frequently use active transportation as a preferred mode of travel.
5. Transportation options in the region are net zero for carbon emissions and affordable for those least able to pay.
6. All modes of transportation, including new, disruptive technologies, are safely integrated resulting in few transit related injuries and zero fatalities annually.
7. Municipalities work together and with the Commonwealth to create seamless travel throughout the region, including “first mile, last mile” connections.
